# STL-of-floor-plan
## background
I was tasked to create an STL file of an HDB floorplan, 09-305@120510, using chatGPT. An image of the floor plan is proivided below, which was also provided to chatGPT. . STLs of each individual parts of each of the rooms can be found in FullUnitSTLs. The STL of the entire apartment with closed mesh can be found in FullUnit_ClosedMesh. JSON files genrated by ChatGPT containing the wall verticies of all walls in each room are also provided in this repository.

This pdf guide explaining how to interpret HDB floor plans was provided to chatGPT such that it could generate the STL files.
